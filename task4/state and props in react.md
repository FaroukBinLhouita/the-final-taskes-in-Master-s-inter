# Understanding State and Props in React

## What is State?

The state in React is an object that represents the parts of a component that can change. Each component has its own state, which resides in an object. When the state of a component changes, React re-renders the component to update the UI and reflect the new state.

State can be managed using various tools such as:

- **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- **React Toolkit**: A library for managing state with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.
- **Other Tools**: Includes libraries and tools like Redux, MobX, etc., each with its own features and benefits.

## What are Props?

Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from parent components to child components. They enable data to flow down the component tree but not up. Props allow components to be dynamic and reusable by providing them with different values.
